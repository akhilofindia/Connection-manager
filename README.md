Connection Manager


🚀 A C++ Application for Managing User Connections


📌 Overview


Connection Manager is a C++ application designed to manage user connections efficiently. 
It allows users to register, add or remove friends, find common connections, and explore various features using graph-based algorithms.
The project leverages graph data structures to model relationships and implements Dijkstra’s and Prim’s algorithms for optimized connection management.

🔥 Features


📌 User Registration – Add new users to the system.

👥 Friend Management – Establish and remove connections between users.

🔗 Find Common Connections – Identify mutual friends between two users.

📊 Graph-Based Representation – Efficiently manage connections using graph structures.

⚡ Shortest Path Calculation – Uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to determine the shortest connection path.

🏗 Minimum Spanning Tree – Utilizes Prim’s Algorithm for optimized network management.

📁 File Management – Data is stored efficiently for persistence across sessions.


🛠️ Technologies Used

C++ – Core language for implementing the application.

Graph Data Structures – Used for modeling user relationships.

Algorithms (Dijkstra & Prim’s) – Optimized pathfinding and connection analysis.

File Handling – Ensures data persistence.

📌 Future Enhancements


🔍 Advanced Recommendation System – Suggest new friends based on mutual connections.

🌍 Web-Based Interface – Extend functionality via a graphical or web interface.

📊 Data Visualization – Graphical representation of user connections.
